Raddish in the core is an [MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) framework with
[DCI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data,_context_and_interaction) as an extension.
Together it allows to use certain behavior on certain points in the MVC triad.

Further a key element in this framework is that it does a lot automatically. Next to that the fallbacks make sure everything works out-of-the-box.
So you only have to create extra files when overriding certain behavior. Which in turn saves time.

Together with the identifiers to address certain objects it makes for an unbeatable combo.
