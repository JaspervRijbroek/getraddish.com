        <p>
            Component config is a powerfull tool which allows you to override certain variables without having to write a complete object to do so.
            <br/> There are two files for which the system will check. Which is the <code>config.json</code> in the component directory,
            <br/> or the <code>&lt;component_name&gt;/config.json</code> file in the config directory of the application (if specified).
        </p>
        <p>
            The file in the application config directory serves as a fallback when the <code>config.json</code> in the component folder isn't found.
            <br/> In the tutorial extension details on this file are shown.
            <br/> Below I will give an example of how a component config file might look like:

<div class="row">

{% highlight json %}
{
    "table": {
        "account": {
            "db": "mongo",
            "name": "accounts"
        },
        "character": {
            "db": "mongo",
            "name": "characters"
        }
    },
    "dispatcher": {
        "controller": "product"
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
