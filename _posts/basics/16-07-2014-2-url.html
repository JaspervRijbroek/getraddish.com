        <p>
            The system relies a lot on URLs these will be the main entries to the framework. <br/>
            When going to a URL the system will first check if this is a static file, if so it will return this file.
            <br/> If not it will traverse the framework.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The urls of the system have a fixed setting. <br/>
            URLs are build up as follows (this is not for public files) <code>http://example.com/&lt;app&gt;/&lt;component&gt;/&lt;view&gt;</code> where view is optional.
            <br/> If new view is given the system will use the plural of the component name for the view. (unless it is overridden in the dispatcher)
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I will give some examples: <br/><br/>
            
            <code>http://example.com/demo/foo</code> this url will go to the demo application and will run the component foo with the view foos. <br/>
            <code>http://example.com/demo/foo/bar</code> will go to the same application but will go to the view bar.
