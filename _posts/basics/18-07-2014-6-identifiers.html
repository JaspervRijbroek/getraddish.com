        </div>
        
        <p>
            The identifiers are another powerfull tool to receive objects and to interact with them. <br/>
            The identifiers have a specific format and are URIs (Unique Resource Identifiers) as well. <br/>
            Later on in the advanced tutorial I will give an example to register your own Identifier Locator. <br/>
            The identifiers are as follows: <br/><br/>
            
            <code>com://&lt;application&gt;/&lt;component&gt;.&lt;path&gt;.&lt;name&gt;</code> <br/>
            Where path is also dot-separated.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Below a few examples of identifiers and what kind of objects they return.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <code>com://demo/foo.model.bar</code> <br/>
            This identifier will return the model bar from the component foo in the demo application.
            <br/><br/>
            
            <code>com://home/bar.database.table.baz</code> <br/>
            This identifier will return the table object baz from the bar component in the home application.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I hope that this makes the identifiers a little more clear. <br/>
            In the tutorial you will find some more to get more familliar with them.
