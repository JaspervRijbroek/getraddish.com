            Raddish in the core is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" target="_blank">MVC</a> framework with
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data,_context_and_interaction" target="_blank">DCI</a> as an extension. <br/>
            Together it allows to use certain behavior on certain points in the MVC triad.

            Further a key element in this framework is that it does a lot automatically. Next to that the fallbacks make sure everything works out-of-the-box.
            <br/> So you only have to create extra files when overriding certain behavior. Which in turn saves time.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Together with the identifiers to address certain objects it makes for an unbeatable combo.
