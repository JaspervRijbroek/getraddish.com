			You will come at a point where the default isn't enough and you need more functionality, We are please to tell this is no problem at all.
			<br/> There are quite a few places you can override. The places are: The global application scope and the component scope.
			<br/> I will describe them in detail below. Both the scopes have their parts ot override. These are:

			<ul>
				<li>Dispatcher</li>
				<li>Controllers</li>
				<li>Permissions</li>
				<li>Models</li>
				<li>Table</li>
				<li>Row/ Rowset</li>
			</ul>

			This should hold most things you will need.
		</p>

		<h4>Application Scope</h4>

		<p>
			The overrides for the complete application will go in the default component, unfortunately the overrides done here won't work when you have a component specific override.
