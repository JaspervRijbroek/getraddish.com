			You will come at a point where the default isn't enough and you need more functionality, We are please to tell this is no problem at all.
			<br/> There are quite a few places you can override. The places are: The global application scope and the component scope.
			<br/> I will describe them in detail below. Both the scopes have their parts ot override. These are:

			<ul>
				<li>Dispatcher</li>
				<li>Controllers</li>
				<li>Permissions</li>
				<li>Models</li>
				<li>Table</li>
				<li>Row/ Rowset</li>
			</ul>

			This should hold most things you will need.
		</p>

		<h4>Application Scope</h4>
		<p>
			The overrides for the complete application will go in the default component, unfortunately the overrides done here won't work when you have a component specific override.
			<br/> In the component scope We will split everything apart.
		</p>

		<h4>
			Component Scope
		</h4>
		<p>
			These are overrides for specific components and only for this single component. <br/>
			We will go through everything from simple dispatcher and views to behaviours (DCI) <br/>
		</p>

		<h5>Dispatcher</h5>
		<p>
			The dispatcher is the handler of request and response and thus will handle the output accordingly. <br/>
			Also when there is no view given in the request the dispatcher will assume a view which is by default the plural of the component name
		</p>
		<p>
			When you want this can be overridden by adding the config variable controller in the initialize function of the dispatcher, below an example.
	{% highlight javascript linenos %}
	var Dispatcher  = require('raddish').Dispatcher;
	var util        = require('util');

	function ExampleDispatcher() {
		ExampleDispatcher.super_.call(this);
	};

	util.inherits(ExampleDispatcher, Dispatcher);

	ExampleDispatcher.prototype.initialize = function(config) {
		config.controller = 'foo';

		return ExampleDispatcher.super_.prototype.initialize.call(this, config);
	};

	module.exports = ExampleDispatcher;{% endhighlight %}

			In this example we have set the default controller when there is no view found.
