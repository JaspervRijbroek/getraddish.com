			The smaller parts of an application are the components. <br/>
			The system will check if a component exists if it does it might call the dispatcher to further handle the chain.
		</p>
		<p>
			To create a component go to the application you just created and create the components folder you configured.
			<br/> In here create a folder with the name of the application and within this folder create a JavaScript file with the same name.
			<br/> This is the bootstrapper of our component. Below we will show you an example.
		</p>

	{% highlight javascript linenos %}
	var Service = require('raddish').Service;

	function ComponentMenu(request, response) {
		Service.getObject('home:menu.dispatcher')
			.then(function(dispatcher) {
				dispatcher.dispatch(request, response);
			});
	}

	module.exports = ComponentMenu;{% endhighlight %}

		<p>
			What this does is the script will try to get the dispatcher of the component by Identifier (more on identifiers in the next tutorial).
			<br/> And when this call is done it will dispatch the dispatcher with the request and the response.
