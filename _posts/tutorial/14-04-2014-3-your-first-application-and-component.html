		Your first application

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-12">
		Now we will try to create a simple blogging component called blog. <br/>
		We won't be handling the frontend because this can be done the way you like it. <br/>
		But first we have to create an application. The application will be called web. So in our applications folder we create the folder named web.
		<br/> And in this folder we create the folder components. Unfortunately we still rely on a default dispatcher so we have to create this one first.
		<br/> In the components folder we create the folder default, this will hold the component wide overrides and can be used for almost everything.
		<br/> Here we will create the file called dispatcher.js with the following code in there. This is the minimum needed for a dispatcher.
		{% highlight javascript linenos %}
	var Dispatcher  = require('raddish').Dispatcher;
	var util        = require('util');

	function DefaultDispatcher() {
	    DefaultDispatcher.super_.apply(this, arguments);
	}

	util.inherits(DefaultDispatcher, Dispatcher);

	module.exports = DefaultDispatcher;{% endhighlight %}

		After this we are almost done, we still have to add the table the tables will hold a naming convention in this case blog_blogs
		<br/> In this table we have the following columns id, title, content the id column will be a primary key. <br/>
		After this if you send a POST request to http://example.com/web/blog/blog it will add a table entry <br/>
		If you send a POST request to http://example.com/web/blog/blog?id=1 it will update the table row with ID 1 with the posted data.
		<br/><br/>

		This holds the base of a component, when you don't need any extra overrides the default system will take care of everything.
