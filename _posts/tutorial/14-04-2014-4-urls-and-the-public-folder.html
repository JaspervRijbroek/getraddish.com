			By default the system will check the requested application in the default component for a dispatcher <br />
			This dispatcher has to be present or else there will be a 404 error.
		</p>
		<p>
			How do requests look like? <br/>
			<code>http://example.com/&lt;application&gt;/&lt;component&gt;/&lt;view&gt;</code><br/>
			The view is optional when no view is given it will look for the plural of the component eg: component name = menu view name = menus.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can also send get variables as states into the system. The states given to the system will also be given back in the response.
			<br/> Also the will make a difference between singular and plural views, plurals will return a list and singulars will return or an empty object if it doen't exists or a filled row object.
		</p>
		<p>
			So what is the deal with the public folder? <br/>
			This is the folder where all the public files are located. You can access them as expected eg: http://example.com/css/foo.css
			<br/> will try to get file from the public folder, if it can't be found the request will be handled as a framework request.
