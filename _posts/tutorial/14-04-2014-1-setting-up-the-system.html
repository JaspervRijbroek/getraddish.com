		<p>
			First we have to create a two files the application file <code>app.js</code> and <code>config.js</code> the file config.js will hold all the config options <br />
			like default output format and databases.
		</p>
		<p>
			The app.js is very simple below is an example to use in a project.
	{% highlight javascript linenos %}
	var Router  = require('raddish').Router;
	var http    = require('http');

	http.createServer(function(req, res) {
		new Router().route(req, res);
	}).listen(1337);
	console.log('Server running on port: 1337');{% endhighlight %}
		</p>
		<p>
			This will create a http server which will listen to requests, when you request a file or data from the application the router will handle the request. <br />
			When the file is found it will return it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next is the config.js where all the configuration options are set. Below I will give an example to use.

	{% highlight javascript linenos %}
	module.exports = {
		"db": {
			"default": {
				"host": "localhost",
				"port": 3306,
				"user": "root",
				"password": "root",
				"database": "foo"
			}
		},
		"layout": "json",
		"gzip": false
	}{% endhighlight %}
		</p>
		<p>
			We will explain the values

		<dl>
			<dt>db</dt>
			<dd>
				This object holds all the database connections there must be a default connection <br />
				this one will be used by default for other connections you can add ass many as you need/ want.
			</dd>

			<dt>layout</dt>
			<dd>
				This is the default format which will be outputted by the system, by default this is JSON <br />
				this can be changed to every layout you want. Also if you want a single request to have a different layout <br />
				yo can send the get-variable layout in the request with the needed layout type, by default only JSON is in the core.
			</dd>

			<dt>gzip</dt>
			<dd>Allow the response data to be gzipped to save bandwith data, this might be useful for mobile applications.</dd>
		</dl>
		</p>
		<p>
			This was it for the basic setup and some information about the basics of the system.
