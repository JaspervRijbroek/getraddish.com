			First we have to create a two files the application file <code>app.js</code> and <code>config.js</code> the file config.js will hold all the config options <br />
			like default output format and databases.
		</p>
		<p>
			The app.js is very simple below is an example to use in a project.
	{% highlight javascript linenos %}
	var raddish = require('raddish');

	raddish.setConfig(require('./config.js');
	raddish.setApplication('foo', 'apps/foo/app.js');

	raddish.start();{% endhighlight %}
		</p>
		<p>
			This will require raddish as the npm module and all we have to do here is set the config, this can either be the config.js file or an Object literal.
			<br/> After this we register our "foo" application and point it to the application file. Here you can have as much applications as you want.<br/>
			After this has been done we will start raddish by calling the start command.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next is the config.js where all the configuration options are set. Below I will give an example to use.

	{% highlight javascript linenos %}
	module.exports = {
		"db": {
			"default": {
				"host": "localhost",
				"port": 3306,
				"user": "root",
				"password": "root",
				"database": "foo",
				"prefix": false
			}
		},
		"router": {
			"cors": {
				"origin": "*",
				"headers": "*",
				"credentials": true,
				"method": ["get", "post"],

			},
			"routes": {
				"/foo": "/home/menu/items"
			}
		},
		"layout": "json",
		"gzip": false,
		"port": 1337,
		"threads": {
			"maxThreads": 16,
			"maxThreshold": 50,
			"minThreshold": 10,
			"interval": 500
		}
	}{% endhighlight %}
		</p>
		<p>
			We will explain the values

		<dl>
			<dt>db</dt>
			<dd>
				This object holds all the database connections there must be a default connection <br />
				this one will be used by default for other connections you can add ass many as you need/ want.
			</dd>

			<dt>router</dt>
			<dd>
				This is the router config, in here you can set the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers, <br/>
				and the routes used in the system.
			</dd>

			<dt>layout</dt>
			<dd>
				This is the default format which will be outputted by the system, by default this is JSON <br />
				this can be changed to every layout you want. Also if you want a single request to have a different layout <br />
				you can send the get-variable layout in the request with the needed layout type, by default only JSON is in the core.
			</dd>

			<dt>gzip</dt>
			<dd>Allow the response data to be gzipped to save bandwith data, this might be useful for mobile applications.</dd>

			<dt>port</dt>
			<dd>The port on which the application will listen.</dd>

			<dt>threads</dt>
			<dd>
				This is a special one, this one can contain false, true or an object <br/>
				When giving false the threading will be completely disabled, when give try it will be started with the default settings as shown in the example <br/>
				When given an object you can override some or all the defaults.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		</p>
		<p>
			This was it for the basic setup and some information about the basics of the system.
