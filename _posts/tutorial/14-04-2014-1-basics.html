	<h1>Basics</h1>
</div>

<p>
	First of, thanks for taking the time to check out this framework. <br/>
	Whenever you find a bug, have a request or want to share an idea you are more than welcome to contact me by github.
</p>

<h4>This Framework</h4>
<p>
	This framework has been created with the intention of a framework which is decoupled and usable for mobile and other devices.
	<br/> This way we ended up only returning data, which then can be used for different (frontend) frameworks or applications.
</p>
<p>
	In the base this framework is a typical MVC framework with an extension to DCI used in the behaviors. <br/>
	Together build with s few more behaviors the framework is extraordinary versatile and able to work in most situations.
</p>

<h4>Internals</h4>
<p>
	The framework is based on identifiers, this are a kind of pointer which will return the object to which the identifier leads to.
	<br/> for more information about Identifiers you can read <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/tutorial/identifiers.html">here</a>. This provides a way for dry programming, and reusing code.
</p>
<p>
	Next to the amazing behavior of the identifiers the system has the option to work only as an api behind Apache or Nginx
	<br/> or even be used in express.js. Which is supported by default.
</p>
<p>
	Further more there is little to configure inside of the applications so most is done with a configuration file.
	<br/> This file must be set manually.
</p>

<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>
	Because the system by default serves JSON it is usable for a wide range of applications, so it can be used for mobile apps, desktop apps or even websites.
	<br/> If you would like this system to serve HTML it is possible but this requires an extra implementation which needs to be done by the developer.
