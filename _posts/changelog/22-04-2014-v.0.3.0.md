Now it is time for the second public beta and most likely the last step before the official release.
This version ofcourse holds some improvements in usage and speed.

One of the biggest parts that we have implemented is the Threads object which automatically scales processes.
The configuration options available are:

- maxThreads: The maximal amount of threads the object can start.
- maxThreshold: What is the maximum cpu usage before creating a new process.
- minThreshold: What is the minimal cpu usage to kill a process
- interval: the time to wait between checks

Further this object is maintaince free.
