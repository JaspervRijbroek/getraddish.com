<p>
    Another release of Raddish. <br/>
    This time some minor changes.
</p>
<p>
    We have done some work on the performance of Raddish and the table object. <br/>
    The table methods have been split up only using the specific actions and the rest is parsed in the execute method.
</p>
<p>
    Also we have added an EmberJS layout which you can use with your EmberJS projects.
</p>
