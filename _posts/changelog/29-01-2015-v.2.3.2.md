This time a bugfix release.

This time we have changed some parts of the API, this is specially done for the commandChain.
This object used to be a promise, which now is a normal object.

Next to this there are some changes in other objects as well. Which makes it overall a little faster and better to read.
Also the behaviors have been updated.
    
Also we released an EmberJS plugin, containing mixins to use in your applications,
to make support for EmberJS even better. It is installable by bower (```bower install raddish-ember```)

#### List of changes

- Improved behaviors
- Refactored the commandChain
- Release EmberJS plugin
