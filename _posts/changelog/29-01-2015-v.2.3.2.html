<p>
    This time a bugfix release.
</p>
<p>
    This time we have changed some parts of the API, this is specially done for the commandChain. <br/>
    This object used to be a promise, which now is a normal object.
</p>
<p>
    Next to this there are some changes in other objects as well. Which makes it overall a little faster and better to read.
    <br/> Also the behaviors have been updated.
</p>
<p>
    Also we released an EmberJS plugin, containing mixins to use in your applications,
    to make support for EmberJS even better. It is installable by bower (<code>bower install raddish-ember</code>)
</p>
