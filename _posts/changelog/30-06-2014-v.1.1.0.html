<p>
    This the second stable release for public use. <br/>
    This release hold a lot of features and speed improvements. And more cache control.
</p>
<p>
    Also thanks to the loader sequence you can chose which object the framework needs to load when. <br/>
    This can be very handy when you want to inject a component no matter what.
</p>
<p>
    Also there now is a config variable called cache. <br/>
    When this is enabled the framework will cache all the objects improving speed greatly. <br/>
    It is possible to prevent an object from being cached by adding <code>this.cache = false.</code> to the object its constructor.
