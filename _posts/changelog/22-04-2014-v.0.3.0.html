<p>
	Now it is time for the second public beta and most likely the last step before the official release. <br/>
	This version ofcourse holds some improvements in usage and speed.
</p>
<p>
	One of the biggest parts that we have implemented is the Threads object which automatically scales processes. <br/>
	The configuration options available are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>maxThreads: The maximal amount of threads the object can start.</li>
	<li>maxThreshold: What is the maximum cpu usage before creating a new process.</li>
	<li>minThreshold: What is the minimal cpu usage to kill a process</li>
	<li>interval: the time to wait between checks</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Further this object is maintaince free.
