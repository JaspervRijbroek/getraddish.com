Just like any other framework ours too has some unique features.  
And just like any other these features are amazing. I will list them below.

**Rapid Application Development**  
The system will do a lot automatically for you,  
So you don't have to worry about creating files, this is only needed for overrides.

**Multi database support**  
We support multiple databases meaning that you can have mongo, couch or mysql in a single project.  
This also means that you can have multiple connections to different databases in a single project as well.

**Component config**  
We allow you to set basic information into a component config so you don't have to write a complete object to override a simple variable.

**Integrated Socket.IO**  
You will be able to use socket.io wherever you want.  
So you can bind your own events in your own components.

**Integrated threads handler**  
When the server becomes more busy the threads handler will automatically scale up to use more cores.  
This will help to speedup at times of load.

**Plugins**  
This gives you the ability to change behaviors of your system.

**Streaming**  
The system has the capability to be streaming and non-streaming.  
With this you don't have to change or edit your code. It just works.
