            Raddish is a NodeJS Framework incorporating the power of MVC and DCI in a single framework. <br />
            Based on output and components this framework is completely decoupled. And perhaps the only framework you will ever need for web applications.

        <p>
            Letting you write less code to reach the same goal, <br/>
            By using a fallback system your application will function without a huge amount of code. <br/>
            Meaning that you only have to code when you want to override certain functionality.

        </div>

        <p>
            Powered by Promises and Threads the framework is amazingly fast, and endlessly scalable for huge projects which require power above all.

            The API will only return data therefore greatly based for an API of a frontend framework like Angular or Ember, even a mobile app.
