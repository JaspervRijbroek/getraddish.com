			In this section we will guide you throught the steps of creating your own application and the basic setup. <br />
			For further documentation about the objects and accepted parameters/ return values you can check the API section.
		</p>
		<p>
			For this introduction we will use the router which is part of the system, which ia very basic, <br />
			Check for static files if it is available return it, else try to receive data from the framework.

		<h2>
			Setting up the system
		</h2>

		<p>
			First we have to create a two files the application file <code>app.js</code> and <code>config.js</code> the file config.js will hold all the config options <br />
			like default output format and databases.
		</p>
		<p>
			The app.js is very simple below is an example to use in a project.
			<pre>var Router  = require('raddish').Router;
var http    = require('http');

http.createServer(function(req, res) {
	new Router().route(req, res);
}).listen(1337);
console.log('Server running on port: 1337');</pre>
		</p>
		<p>
			This will create a http server which will listen to requests, when you request a file or data from the application the router will handle the request. <br />
			When the file is found it will return it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next is the config.js where all the configuration options are set. Below I will give an example to use.

			<pre>module.exports = {
	"db": {
		"default": {
			"host": "localhost",
			"port": 3306,
			"user": "root",
			"password": "root",
			"database": "foo"
		}
	},
	"layout": "json",
	"gzip": false
}</pre>
		</p>
		<p>
			We will explain the values

			<dl>
				<dt>db</dt>
				<dd>
					This object holds all the database connections there must be a default connection <br />
					this one will be used by default for other connections you can add ass many as you need/ want.
				</dd>

				<dt>layout</dt>
				<dd>
					This is the default format which will be outputted by the system, by default this is JSON <br />
					this can be changed to every layout you want. Also if you want a single request to have a different layout <br />
					yo can send the get-variable layout in the request with the needed layout type, by default only JSON is in the core.
				</dd>

				<dt>gzip</dt>
				<dd>Allow the response data to be gzipped to save bandwith data, this might be useful for mobile applications.</dd>
			</dl>
		</p>
		<p>
			This was it for the basic setup and some information about the basics of the system.
		</p>

		<h2>Setup your first Application/ Component</h2>

		<p>
			By default the system will check the requested application in the default component for a dispatcher <br />
			This dispatcher has to be present or else there will be a 404 error.
		</p>
		<p>
			How do requests look like? <br/>
			http://example.com/&lt;application&gt;/&lt;component&gt;/&lt;view&gt; <br/>
			The view is optional when no view is given it will look for the plural of the component eg: component name = menu view name = menus.
