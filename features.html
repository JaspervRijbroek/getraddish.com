    <h1>Features</h1>
</div>

<p>
    Just like any other framework ours too has some unique features. <br/>
    And just like any other these features are amazing. I will list them below.
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Rapid Application Development</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            The system will do a lot automatically for you, <br/>
            So you don't have to worry about creating files, this is only needed for overrides.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <br/>
    <dt>Multi database support</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            We support multiple databases meaning that you can have mongo, couch or mysql in a single project. <br/>
            This also means that you can have multiple connections to different databases in a single project as well.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <br/>
    <dt>Component config</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            We allow you to set basic information into a component config so you don't have to write a complete object to override a simple variable.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <br/>
    <dt>Integrated Socket.IO</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            You will be able to use socket.io wherever you want. <br/>
            So you can bind your own events in your own components.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <br/>
    <dt>Integrated threads handler</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            When the server becomes more busy the threads handler will automatically scale up to use more cores. <br/>
            This will help to speedup at times of load.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <br/>
    <dt>Plugins</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            This gives you the ability to change behaviors of your system.
        </p>
    </dd>
