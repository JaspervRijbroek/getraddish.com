Raddish-Ember is the Raddish plugin/ library for <a href="http://emberjs.com/" target="_blank">Ember</a>.
This will make your life using Raddish in combination with Ember a lot easier, Raddish-Ember takes the need to create custom overrides for adapters
over from the developer, and maps these automatically to the correct model and Raddish component.
