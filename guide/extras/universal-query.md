The universal query module has been created as a separate query builder to use in other projects.
But it originated from the Raddish query builder and the idea to create a stand-alone query builder for multiple databases.

This is what created Universal Query, this query builder has one generic API for MongoDB and MySQL.

To read more about the API please read the [API docs](/api/universal-query/).
