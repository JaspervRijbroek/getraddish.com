Within Raddish it is possible to use sockets. Also in Raddish-Ember the possibility for sockets has been added.  
So it is possible to use the ```RaddishSockets``` as a mixin in the route object.

This will automatically bind sockets to the current selected controller and model without any extra parameters.  
Which events are also automatically bound to the events fired by raddish.
