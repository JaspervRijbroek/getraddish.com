Within Raddish we are giving some extras as well.

## Universal Query
Universal Query is a query builder for MySQL, MongoDB and SQlite.
However this isn't that great, the great part is in its API.
The API will stay exactly the same no matter to which database you are connecting. There is absolutely no difference in the API.

## Raddish-Ember
For the Ember developers we are supporter of Ember and so in Raddish we have a native output for ember.
But we will take it even further and therefore we have developed a plugin for Ember,
this plugin will take care of some nice features which otherwise are a pain to program.
